Open Detector Package (ODP)
================================================================================
ODP is a package that contains Cisco provided LUA detectors and some application
meta data. Specifically, it contains the following artifacts: 
a. Application detectors in Lua language.

b. Port detectors, which are port only application detectors, in  meta-data in YAML format.

c. appMapping.data file containing application metadata. This file should not
   be modified.  The first column contains application identifier and last column
   contains application name.  Other columns contain internal information.

d. Lua library files DetectorCommon.lua, flowTrackerModule.lua and
   hostServiceTrackerModule.lua


INSTALLAITON
User can install ODP package in any directory of its choosing and configure
this directory in 'app_detector_dir' option in appId preprocessor configuration. 
Directory location "/usr/local/cisco/apps" is recommended. Before installation,
it is recommended to delete "odp" subdirectory 

When installed, ODP will create following sub-directories:
    odp/port    //Cisco port-only detectors
    odp/lua     //Cisco Lua detectors
    odp/libs    //Cisco Lua modules

Installing ODP will not modify any subdirectory named custom, where
user-created detectors are located.

Example: 
    cd /usr/local/cisco/apps
    rm -rf odp
    tar -xzvf <ODP package>
